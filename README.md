Problem statement:
 Smart Cities: Predictive Traffic Management
Scenario:
Design a deep learning model to predict traffic congestion in real-time and suggest alternative
routes.
Requirements:
• Use live traffic data and historical patterns from APIs like Google Maps or OpenTraffic.
• Train an LSTM or Transformer-based model to predict congestion levels.
• Integrate predictions into a dashboard for visualization and decision-making.
• Incorporate weather and event-based features for improved accuracy.
Challenge:
Develop the system to adapt to sudden changes, such as accidents or road closures.
